Dear MRI Researchers,

<br>
On behalf of the chapter executive, we would very much like you to save the 9th and 10th of November 2022 for the Annual Chapter Scientific meeting at UNSW, in Sydney.
<br>
<br>
We are looking forward to welcoming you to our face-to-face Scientific meeting after covid!

<br>
The meeting will also include oral and poster sessions where Chapter members will have the opportunity to present their work. 
As in the previous year, there will be awards for the best oral and poster presentations.
