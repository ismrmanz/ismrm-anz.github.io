ANZ ISMRM Division rep Sarah Hellewell and Communications team, Phoebe Imms and Adam Clement have been working tirelessly to organise this Diffusion MRI focused workshop. They have brought together diffusion experts from across ANZ to provide morning and afternoon informative and interactive sessions on the latest diffusion acquisitions, modelling techniques and applications.
 
Whether you are just starting out in the field of diffusion MRI or want to refresh and update your knowledge, the morning presentations and afternoon parallel interactive sessions provide something for all levels.
